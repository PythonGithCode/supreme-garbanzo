4.4.5 Externalities
Fossil fuel leasing ignores the costs of externalities – it prioritizes short‑term
benefits at the expense of long‑term ones.

3. Ignoring the Cost of Production Externalities
Interior’s planning processes and lease terms do not account for the externality costs of
oil, gas, and coal produced on federal land. In 1920, when Congress first set minimum
royalty rates at 12.5 percent for federal oil and natural gas production, legislators did
not understand the direct link between producing, transporting, and burning fossil fu‑
els, all of which emit greenhouse gases, and climate change, with its effects on human
and environmental health and wellbeing. Today, the connection is clear; scientific un‑
derstanding of the environmental impacts of fossil fuel production has advanced and
economic tools to measure the cost of these impacts, such as the Social Cost of Carbon
and Social Cost of Methane, have been used by several federal agencies to measure the
costs and benefits of proposed regulations.97
Because environmental externalities vary with the amount of fossil fuels that are pro‑
duced, these costs could theoretically be recouped through the royalty rate (as opposed
to minimum bids which are paid prior to actual production). In this manner, the roy‑
alty rate can be used as type of Pigouvian tax: a tax levied on an activity that generates
negative externalities.98
This Article focuses its recommendations on “upstream” externalities that stem directly
from production on federal lands at the mine or well site, as opposed to “downstream”
externalities from coal, oil, and natural gas combustion. Many upstream externalities
are not addressed by existing regulations and therefore represent uncompensated social
and environmental costs. Further, by focusing recommendations on upstream external‑
ities, this Article avoids any potential “double counting” of greenhouse gas emission
costs that could come into play if other regulations, like EPA’s Clean Power Plan, target
downstream combustion emissions.99

The oil and gas industry is the nation’s largest industrial source of methane pollu‑
tion.100 The United States loses at least 1 to 3 percent of its total natural gas production
each year when methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is leaked, flared (burned), or
vented to the atmosphere during natural gas and oil production and distribution.101
Oil and gas production also contributes to smog, particulate matter emissions, and
hazardous air pollution.102 Injection wells used to dispose fracking wastewater can
induce earthquakes.103 Wildlife habitat is impaired by drilling infrastructure. Oil and
gas production use large quantities of fresh water, which is an externality in regions
without efficient water markets.104
Vented and flared methane is also a waste of a valuable resource: natural gas.105 The
Mineral Leasing Act directs Interior to “use all reasonable precautions to prevent waste
of oil or gas developed in the land,”106 yet taxpayers lose as much as ~$23 million in
royalty revenue from fugitive methane emissions each year.107 In November 2016, BLM
finalized a rule governing venting and flaring on federal lands, which was expected to
reduce methane emissions by 41 to 60 percent.108 However, BLM has since stayed im‑
plementation of this rule;109 and even with the new standards in place, some methane
and carbon dioxide would still be released into the atmosphere.110
Coal mining accounts for about 10 percent of domestic methane emissions.111 Unlike
for oil and gas, BLM does not regulate methane emissions from coal production. Coal
mining also emits other air pollutants and has the potential to pollute waterways and
sensitive habitat with acid mine drainage and other byproducts. It also uses a significant
amount of water for dust control, extraction, and processing.112
For offshore oil and gas development, environmental externalities include the risk of
oil spills arising from accidents; improper treatment and disposal of produced wastew‑
ater; air pollution, including methane emissions and hazardous air pollutants; and habi‑
tat disruption, including seabed impacts and marine mammal ship‑strike mortality.113
Other externalities include negative effects on commercial fisheries, subsistence fishing,
and tourism if there is a large offshore oil spill, as witnessed with the BP Deepwater
Horizon disaster.114
The transportation of coal, oil, and gas also results in externalities, including green‑
house gas and particulate matter emissions, rail congestion, fatalities, noise, and con‑
gestion.115 In fact, up to 70 percent of all rail traffic in the United States is dedicated to
shipping coal.116 Offshore, transportation of oil by barge increases the risk of oil spills,
and also contributes greenhouse gas emissions.117

Failure to account for the externality costs of fossil fuel production through regulation,
lease‑specific mitigation requirements,118 or adjustments to fiscal lease terms means
that the public bears the burden of mitigating and adapting to such costs, including
greenhouse gas emissions—the effects of which will continue to be felt decades from
now. As a consequence, the market price of fossil fuels is less than the socially opti‑
mal price, which leads to inefficiently high levels of extraction. In other words, failure
to account for the environmental costs of production prioritizes short‑term fossil fuel
industry profits over long‑term public welfare.
